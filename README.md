To adjust your project based on the assessment description and criteria, here are some suggestions for improvement:

# Home Page (10 marks):

```Need to put date, time, loc ...etc on the event cards```

Current Strengths: The homepage provides a clear welcome message and a search bar for users to find events. Categories and recent events are displayed, which is a great starting point.
Improvements:
Add a section that explicitly displays categories of events (e.g., Rock, Jazz) in a more interactive way, like clickable icons or dropdowns for filtering.
Ensure the "status" of events (Open, Sold Out, etc.) is visually prominent and consistently placed across all event cards​(index)​(index).

# Event Details Page (10 marks):

Current Strengths: The page presents event details, pricing, and available tickets, and includes a comments section. The structure is solid.
Improvements:
Ensure the page design is more responsive by adjusting layout elements for smaller screens (e.g., flex-wrap for images and details).
The ticket selection and booking button could be made more visually prominent​(detail)​(eventDetail).

# Event Creation/Update Page (10 marks):

Current Strengths: The form captures all relevant fields like event name, description, artist, venue, date, category, and number of tickets.
Improvements:
Add validation messages to improve the user experience when entering incorrect or missing information (using JavaScript).
Include clearer labels for input types (like number of tickets) and adjust the styling of buttons for better alignment with Bootstrap styles​(create)​(createEvent).

# User Booking History Page (10 marks):

Current Strengths: The page shows past bookings with event images, booking dates, and order IDs.
Improvements:
Add a search or filter function so users can easily find a particular event in their booking history (if there are many events).
Make sure that the booking card layout is fully responsive, especially on mobile devices​(ticket)​(bookTicket).

# General Bootstrap Use:

Ensure Bootstrap components (like buttons, grids, and forms) are fully utilized for responsiveness. For example, using Bootstrap's grid system in the event details page and user booking history will improve layout adaptability across devices​(create)​(ticket).
Custom CSS is used effectively, but there’s room for more Bootstrap-specific classes to streamline the design process. Consider using pre-built Bootstrap components for alerts, badges, and form elements where appropriate to enhance responsiveness.

# Navigation & User Experience:

Ensure navigation across pages is intuitive and free of broken links. For example, the homepage’s event cards should link correctly to event detail pages and should navigate smoothly​(index).
Highlight the active page in the navigation bar for better usability, so users can easily know which section they are on.
These adjustments will help improve your score, making the prototype more convincing and responsive. Let me know if you need further help with specific changes!
